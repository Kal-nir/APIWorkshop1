    Problem Set A
    Title: A Time in the Delta World

    Description: Youâ€™re an employee at FedUp Games, you are involved in a project about a platformer game.
    Your task is to create the movement algorithm of the player. The Vector Object is responsible with the movement of the player.
    All you need to do is to return the movement based on the speed times the vector. As for the jumping aspect,
    check if the character is on the floor, and if true, the character will be able to jump.
    Every product must be multiplied by the delta time.

    Objective: To work with ADTs and Objects in a game setting.
